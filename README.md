# The-Dice-Game
The Dice Game is a captivating front-end web development project designed for two players, where each player rolls a virtual dice to compete. The page features a simple yet attractive layout, displaying dice images for Player 1 and Player 2 side by side. Upon refreshing the page, JavaScript generates random numbers for each dice, dynamically updating the images to reflect the roll. The game determines the winner based on the higher number rolled, displaying a congratulatory message for the winning player. If both players roll the same number, the game announces a draw. 

The intuitive design ensures an engaging user experience, while CSS styling adds polish to the visuals. The project emphasizes interactivity and randomness, showcasing the seamless integration of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Itâ€™s a fun example of how programming logic can bring a game to life on a web page. With its lightweight functionality and competitive appeal, the Dice Game offers entertainment while illustrating key front-end development concepts.
